## More

We recommend that you first read [GettingStarted.md](https://github.com/CMihai99/medita/blob/main/docs/how-to/GettingStarted.md)
for information on everything you need to know by describing the process
you need to go through, and how to work with the community. It will also
try to explain some of the reasons why the community works like it does,
and how to setup development.
